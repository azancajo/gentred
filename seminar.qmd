## Rationale

Urban transformation and socio-spatial reconfiguration are key forces shaping contemporary societies. Globalization has deepened social fragmentation and polarization, driving inequalities and reshaping urban landscapes. Since the mid-1970s, rising social inequality and the weakening capacity of national and local governments to counteract it have intensified residential segregation and economic disparities. The nature of segregation and other spatial inequalities varies across global cities, shaped by urban histories, economic restructuring, welfare state shifts, and housing policies.

In recent years, these trends have accelerated due to significant demographic shifts. Migration flows and urban policies have altered the social composition of neighbourhoods and schools, while touristification and gentrification have transformed urban landscapes, influencing education inequalities. Simultaneously, urban and education policies have increasingly adopted neoliberal approaches, seen in housing market liberalization and expanded school choice policies.

The interplay between urban transformations and education policies is central to shaping socio- spatial inequalities in education. Spatial restructuring influences school hierarchies, reshapes local education markets, and reinforces links between residential and school segregation. These dynamics intersect with policies on school admissions, the diversification of educational supply, and the redefinition of catchment areas, often producing uncertain effects on socio-spatial inequalities. The complex interactions between housing markets, education policies, and family strategies generate emerging forms of educational inequality that remain insufficiently explored. This seminar brings together researchers from diverse urban contexts and disciplines to examine how urban change, spatial inequalities, and education policies intersect to shape education inequalities. Key themes include:

-   The impact of urban transformations, migration, and demographic shifts on school segregation.

-   The role of school choice policies, school admission regulations and processes, and parental strategies in shaping educational inequalities.

-   Patterns of school choice and student mobility in urban settings.

-   Intersections between housing policies, urban renewal, and educational access.

-   The effects of gentrification on school composition and educational outcomes. Policy responses and interventions to reduce school segregation and promote equity.
